## Project Overview

## Self Assessment and Reflection

<!-- Edit the following section with your self assessment and reflection -->

I believe this project was quite the eye opener when it came to handling data of all kinds and various different ways to display them.

### Self Assessment
<!-- Replace the (...) with your score -->

| Category          | Score    |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| **Setup**         | 10 / 10 |
| **Execution**     | 20 / 20 |
| **Documentation** | 5 / 10 |
| **Presentation**  | 30 / 30 |
| **Total**         | 65 / 70 |

### Reflection
<!-- Edit the following section with your reflection -->

#### What went well?

All my data and its handling and visualizations came together pretty easily which helped a lot throughout my project.

#### What did not go well?

During Checkpoint 2, my code did not end up pushing which got me a lower grade for that checkpoint but apart from everything nothing really went horribly wrong.

#### What did you learn?

Multiple data handling techniques and the importance of setting up datasets.

#### What would you do differently next time?

No specific reason to this but I would like to work with more complex data structures in the future.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
